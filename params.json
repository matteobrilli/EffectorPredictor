{"name":"EffectorPredictor ","tagline":"EffectorPredictor is a pipeline for virulence - related gene prediction from one or multiple genomes.","body":"\r\n### What it is\r\nEffectorPredictor (EP) is a pipeline combining several pieces of software with the aim of returning a reliable identification of positively selected genes from pathogen genomes. After a stringent clustering of protein sequences, EffectorPredictor performs state of the art positive selection analysis on all the clusters. Additional tools are run to provide an output integrating different sources of information, such as presence of Pfam domains and signal peptide for secretion.\r\nA less stringent clustering is also run to provide a classification into homologous groups and to identify proteins similar to known effectors if these sequences are provided at the beginning of the analysis, or simply to aggregate the clusters for which positive selection was calculated. Each homologous cluster is also used as an input to Meme to identify recurrent proteins motifs, as it is known that effectors are often characterized by those signatures. These motifs are used to scan all the sequences for additional occurrences and the data is reported as matlab compatible files for additional, manual analysis.\r\n\r\n### Java dependencies\r\n\r\n\r\n### Third-party required software\r\n\r\n\r\n### Citation\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nmatteo.brilli@fmach.it","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
